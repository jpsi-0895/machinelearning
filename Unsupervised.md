# Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning algorithms where the algorithms are used to find the patterns, structure or relationship within a dataset using unlabled dataset. It explores the dataâ€™s inherent structure without predefined categories or labels.

- Clustering
