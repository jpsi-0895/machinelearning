# Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms are computational models that allow computers to understand patterns and forecast or make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are three types of machine learning algorithms.

1. Supervised Learning
    - Regression
    - Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
    - Dimensionality Reduction
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning Algorithm

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithms where we used labeled dataset to train the model or algorithms. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping from the input data to the output labels, allowing it to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

### Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

1. Linear Model:
    - Regression
        1. Ordinary Least Square Regression
        2. Simple Linear Regression
        3. ultiple Linear Regression
        4. Polynomial Regression
        5. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)
        5. Bayesian Regression
        6. Quantile Regression
        7. Isotonic regression
        8. Stepwise regression
        9. Least-angle regression (LARS)
    - Classification:
        1. Logistic Regression
        2. Sigmoid & Softmax functions
    - Regularization:
        1. Lasso (L1 Regularization)
        2. Ridge (L2 Regularization)
        3. Ridge regression
        4. Ridge Classifier
