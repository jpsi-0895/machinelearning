# Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms are computational models that allow computers to understand patterns and forecast or make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are three types of machine learning algorithms.

1. Supervised Learning
    - Regression
    - Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
    - Dimensionality Reduction
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning Algorithm

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithms where we used labeled dataset to train the model or algorithms. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping from the input data to the output labels, allowing it to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.
