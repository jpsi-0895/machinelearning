# Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms are computational models that allow computers to understand patterns and forecast or make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are three types of machine learning algorithms.

1. Supervised Learning
    - Regression
    - Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
    - Dimensionality Reduction
3. Reinforcement Learning
